# Sentiment Analysis of Flipkart Reviews

**Powered by Karthik Vana | Data Engineer | ML Engineer | AI Engineer**

## 📌 Project Overview
An end-to-end, production-ready Sentiment Analysis system designed to classify Flipkart product reviews (specifically for the YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle) into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment. It also extracts key **pain points** from negative reviews to identify customer dissatisfaction themes.

This project demonstrates a full-stack AI application, featuring a custom-trained Machine Learning model, a fast Python API, and a modern, interactive Next.js frontend.

## 🚀 Features

### Core AI Capabilities
-   **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies reviews with high accuracy (F1-Score ~92%) using a Logistic Regression model trained on TF-IDF embeddings.
-   **Pain Point Extraction**: Automatically identifies specific complaints (e.g., "bad quality", "waste of money") from negative reviews.
-   **Real-time Inference**: Low-latency predictions via a FastAPI backend.

### Modern Web Interface
-   **Interactive UI**: Built with Next.js 15 and TailwindCSS.
-   **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth fade-ins, glassmorphism effects, and animated gradients.
-   **User Preferences**: Toggleable settings for animations and high-contrast mode.
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (React), TailwindCSS, Lucide Icons
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Python 3.10+
-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Joblib
-   **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Vercel/Render (Backend)

## ⚡ Quick Start (Local)

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model (if not already trained)
python -m src.train_model

# Run the API
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
*API runs at `http://localhost:8000`*

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```
*App runs at `http://localhost:3000`*

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | F1-Score | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.92** | **92%** |
| Random Forest | 0.90 | 90% |
| Naive Bayes | 0.89 | 89% |

*The Logistic Regression model was selected for its balance of high accuracy and extremely low inference latency.*

## 🔮 Future Improvements
-   Implement Deep Learning models (BERT/RoBERTa) for potentially higher nuance detection.
-   Add a dashboard for visualization of bulk review uploads.
-   Deploy as a containerized microservice using Docker.
